            <p>I love anything sci-fi related as I am a huge Star Wars fan along with any other great sci-fi series or movies. I love to eat curry.

            <p>I love the outdoors and all four seasons. I've lived over 12 years in Florida,which I loved the beaches and sunny weather, but I will always love my home state of Minnesota for its seasons and beautiful nature. </p><br>

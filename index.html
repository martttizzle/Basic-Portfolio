     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>My name is Vinod Martel Ramdin. I go by my middle Martel most often. I love to play and watch sports. I currently play basketball at my local gym and I love to workout as well. I love anything sci-fi related as I am a huge Star Wars fan along with any other great sci-fi series or movies. I love to eat curry. I go to my parents house twice a week to make sure I can eat my mom's curry. I have traveled to Vancouver, BC and it was one of my favorite trips. I love the outdoors and a major fan of all four seasons. I've lived over 12 years in Florida, which felt like one season (summer), but I love my home state of Minnesota for its seasons and beautiful nature </p>

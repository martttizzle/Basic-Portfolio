            <p>My name is Vinod Martel Ramdin. I go by my middle Martel most often. I love to play and watch sports. I currently play basketball at my local gym and I love to workout as well.</p>
            <p>I love anything sci-fi related as I am a huge Star Wars fan along with any other great sci-fi series or movies. I love to eat curry. I go to my parents house twice a week to make sure I can eat my mom's curry. I have traveled to Vancouver, BC and it was one of my favorite trips. I love the outdoors and a major fan of all four seasons. I've lived over 12 years in Florida, which felt like one season (summer), but I love my home state of Minnesota for its seasons and beautiful nature Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
